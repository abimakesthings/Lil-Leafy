<h1>Lil' Leafy</h1>
<p>
This is for the Lil' Leafy project. I designed and 3D printed a cat planter. I hooked up a soil moisture sensor and laser lights for the eyes. 
  The cat gets angry (AKA eyes turn red) when it needs to be watered.
Here's the code I used so that the red lights turn on when the plant needs to be watered, and off when it's been watered. 

I used a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+.
